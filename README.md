This is my first Github, hopefully you find it useful. Thank you for stopping by.

When setting this up, you only need to include a single line of code in all page headers where chat will be used. You can setup a logic to prevent visibility until you need it.

Code:<br>
<code><script src="Genesys-Cloud-Message-Form-main/createDIV1Form/js/setup.js" type="text/javascript"></script></code>

The design is to have a lower-right corner form that was originally on Chat V2. 
Currently the demo asks for: First Name, Last Name, Email Address

Example:<br>
<img width="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/736e8a23-23f2-4049-9975-268eec5ff881" />  <img width="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fc412c4-aa63-41fb-9d82-45d80908c86b" />



Then it brings back those values from the Participant Data and not from the form inputs directly.
