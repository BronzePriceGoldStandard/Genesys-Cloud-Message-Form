When setting this up, you only need to include a single line of code in all page headers where chat will be used. You can setup a logic to prevent visibility until you need it.

Code:<br>
<code><script src="js/setup.js" type="text/javascript"></script></code>

The design is to have a lower-right corner form that was originally on Chat V2. 
Currently the demo asks for: First Name, Last Name, Email Address

Then it brings back those values from the Participant Data and not from the form inputs directly.
